# Personal Portfolio of Sean Morrison

## DESCRIPTION
This is my personal portfolio page. I am using some of my favorite photos from several places I've visited in recent years. I hope you enjoy viewing the photos as much as I enjoyed taking the photos.

## PROCESS FOR MAKING THIS SITE
### Here is a list of things I did to make this site.
  1. First I created the layout using Google Drawings. I sketched out 3 main sizes that I thought might work for this site.
    - Large: Viewport is at least 700px wide (fullscreen computer web browser).
    - Medium: Viewport is at least 500px wide (resized computer web browser).
    - Small: Mobile device.
  2. In Atom, I created the folder structure. My `index.html` is in the root while images are in the `img` folder and style sheets are in the `css` folder.
  3. Then I started coding the basic layout per my Google Drawings mockup. To make this easier, I printed out the mockup so it's sitting next to me on the desk as I type.
  4. And then after many many many many many hours of trial and error, I finally finished my design. It's not the greatest site ever made but it meets the requirements and I learned a ton of new things. I will definitely carry this new knowledge on to the next project.
